{% include process-section.html image="cycling-app-sketches.svg" title="The Design Process" description="The criteria for this assignment involved creating a useful app related to health or fitness. After recently completing the 613 Cycling logo at the time, the cycling community was on my mind. I decided to create an app concept in which users could find other cylists to ride with in their area. This all ties back to the App Definition Statement: Local cyclists need a way to organize group rides so they can excercise and socialize." class="cycling-app-process" class2="cycling-app-process-title" %}
