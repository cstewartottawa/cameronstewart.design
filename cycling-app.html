{% include hero-intro.html title="613 Cycling App" intro="This was a school project in which we were to create an app prototype. This app allows users to create routes/rides and post them in the app. Once created, other users can see the posted rides and choose to join." image="cycling-app.jpg" class="cycling-secondary" class2="cycling-secondary-title" %}
{% include process-section.html image="cycling-app-sketches.svg" title="The Design Process" description="After completing the 613 Cycling logo, the cycling community was on my mind. I decided to create an app concept in which users could find other cyclists to ride with in their area. Throughout the design process, I constantly referred back to the app definition statement: local cyclists need a way to organize group rides so they can exercise and socialize. Referring back to this everytime a new feature was added was a way of ensuring that every decision made related back to the statement and enhanced the user's overall experience." class="cycling-app-process" class2="cycling-app-process-title" %}
