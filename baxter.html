  {% include hero-intro.html title="Limited Edition Packaging" intro="This was a school project in which the objective was to re-design and manufacture limited edition packaging. I chose a classic men's grooming brand, Baxter of California." image="baxter-hero.jpg" class="baxter-intro" %}
  {% include process-section.html image="baxter-sketch.svg" title="The Design Process" description="When considering options for this limited edition packaging I immediately thought of of wood as an option for materials. I knew I wanted to create something that had the capability of standing out on the shelf and that possible customers may retain as a keepsake isntead of throwing away. Although I didn't mind the original packaging, it lacked any attributes that would attract attention to it on the shelves and or equip it with any noteworthy characteristics in order to be showcased as a limited edition product. I also felt that their was a lack of brand representation on the original black and white packaging, having no sign of the signature Baxter of California blue that appears on the vast majority of their products.

  {% include secondary-text.html title="The Box" description="I created the wood box using a laser etching printer from a local woodworking shop. I wanted the wood box to fit tightly around the cardboard box to avoid any potential movement. For the design on the wood box, it was my intention to replicate the design of the cardboard box but remove any supporting information or features -  making the focus on the wood texture and the craftsmanship of the box. I also dipped the tips of the suede rope in to blue paint as a subtle visual link and representation to the Baxter of California brand in the smallest details of the packaging." class="baxter-secondary" class2="baxter-secondary-title"%}
