  {% include secondary-text.html title="The Box" description="I created the wood box using a laser etching printer from a local woodworking shop. I wanted the wood box to fit tightly around the cardboard box to avoid any potential movement. For the design on the wood box, it was my intention to replicate the design of the cardboard box but remove any supporting information or features -  making the focus on the wood texture and the craftsmanship of the box. I also dipped the tips of the suede rope in to blue paint as a subtle visual link and representation to the Baxter of California brand in the smallest details of the packaging.
