Intersted in pursuing a career in branding and UI/UX design however I do enjoy taking on a variety of different jobs and learning new skills. Maybe somehow mention education history here. Maybe something like..I have been lucky enough to have the opportunity to pick up some freelance work during my time at school but am eager to further develop my skills and learn from industry professionals. I am currently seeking a 6-week placement starting in March as graduation requirement in my program. I will graduate this spring(2018).</h3>
